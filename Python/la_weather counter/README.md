# La Weather Script
Hello there,
This is a python script that automates the process of counting the .csv file containing information of the local weather.

### How to proper format input file
Well, it's very simple, once created the `.csv` file, you can simple organize the day or any information you want (~~it will be ignored~~) followed by a comma `','`

Let me show an example:
##### Input file
`Day,Type of Weather`  
`120,Sunny Day`  
`121,Dark Cloud Day`  

It's very important to have on line 0:  
`Day, Type of Weather`

##### Output file  
`Sunny Day : 1 time ~ 50.00%`  
`Dark Cloud Day: 1 time ~ 50.00%`


### Are all programs on final/stable release?
No, i'm just posting them anyway, but i do strongly believe that someday i'll have time to organise and make everything commented.
